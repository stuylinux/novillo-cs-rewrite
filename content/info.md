# Classroom and Lab Rules
- Please read the student handbook and the school policies: Go to [the school website](https://www.stuy.edu/). Under the menu "Students", click on "Schools Policies and Forms" to find relevant information. I have also provided this information in class, so if you do not comply with one of the rules, you cannot use the excuse you did not know it.

- You have signed the Academic Integrity Policy. It is essential to state that you can help your classmates by explaining what they need help understanding, but not by giving them your work, not even letting them see it. Your work is your work. Giving your work to your classmates is not going to help them. They will not learn anything from copying your work. Learning comes from thinking. Copying does not provide any value. I encourage you to help each other because learning from a classmate is a good experience, and helping a classmate is also valuable. When a classmate is struggling, please explain the concepts and, little by little, give them hints that will promote problem-solving.

- Students must respect the teacher and classmates at all times.

- Labs: No food or drinks are allowed in the labs. Labs should be kept clean.

- Students must be on time for class. Please improve your routine if you are often late, especially for the first period. You may wake up 10 minutes earlier or more to take the train/bus, which will help you to be on time for school. If you are late, you will disrupt the class and miss important parts of the lessons, which could affect your learning and your classwork grade.

- Students must pay attention when the teacher gives a lesson. Please do not use the computers during a lesson unless the teacher asks you to do it. Please do not work on assignments for other subjects during my class. Avoid distractions (cell phones). Students who do not comply with this rule will lose classwork points.

- Bathroom: Please do your best to use the bathroom between periods. Students cannot go to the bathroom during an exam or quiz.

- Absence: Students are expected to check the missed lesson/work with their classmates when absent. Generally, I will post slides and homework on our website.

# Important to remember
- Paying attention in class, reviewing the concepts, and doing your homework will benefit your learning. Your brain processes and retains more information if you work on the subject daily instead of learning a big chunk of concepts in one day.

- Have fun in a computer science class. You will be able to learn another kind of logic than the one you are learning in mathematics, physics, or science, and you will be able to test and see your work on the computer.
